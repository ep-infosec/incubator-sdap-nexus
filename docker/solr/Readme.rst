Solr Images
=====================

All docker builds for the Solr images should happen from this directory. For copy/paste ability, first export the environment variable ``BUILD_VERSION`` to the version number you would like to tag images as.

Common Environment Variables
------------------------------

Any environment variable that can be passed to `solr.in.sh <https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/95d01c6583b825b6b87591e4f27002c285ea25fb/solr/bin/solr.in.sh>`_ and be passed as an environment variable to the docker container and it will be utilized. A few options are called out here:

``SOLR_HEAP``
    *default: 512m*

    Increase Java Heap as needed to support your indexing / query needs

``SOLR_HOME``
    *default /opt/solr/server/solr*

    Path to a directory for Solr to store cores and their data. This directory is exposed as a ``VOLUME`` that can be mounted.

If you want to mount the ``SOLR_HOME`` directory to a directory on the host machine, you need to provide the container path to the docker run ``-v`` option. Doing this allows you to retain the index between start/stop of this container.
